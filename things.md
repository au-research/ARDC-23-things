Anyone can do 23 (research data) things at any time. Do them all, do some, cherry-pick the things you need or want to know about. Do them on your own, or get together in a group and share the learning. The program is intended to be flexible, adaptable and fun!

Each of the 23 things offers a variety of learning opportunities with activities at three levels of complexity: 
* Getting started
* Learn more
* Challenge me

All resources used in the program are online and free to use.

The 23 things are designed to build knowledge as the program progresses, so if youâ€™re new to the wonderful world of research data management, we suggest you start with things 1-3 and then decide where you want to go from there.

{% for t in site.things %}
- [Thing {{t.thing}}:]({{site.baseurl}}{{t.url}}) {{t.title}}
  - {{t.description}}
{% endfor %}
