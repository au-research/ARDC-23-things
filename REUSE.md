# Re-purpose toolkit

[![23RDThings
Wordle](images/23T-W-235px.png){#top}](index.md "23 research data Things")

## 23 (research data) Things is here for you!

-   Use as a self paced learning activity or as a refresher
-   Adopt it as suggested training for all staff
-   Contextualize it for your discipline or situation
-   Adapt it to meet your specific research data knowledge needs

    [Institutional examples of reuse](#institional-examples-of-reuse)
    [Resources](#resources)
    [Incentives](#incentives)

The 23 (research data) Things program was rolled out by ANDS during
2016. More than 1500 people participated from across Australia, New
Zealand and beyond. While the program formally ends in October, the
materials developed for 23 (research data) Things will remain available
on the ANDS website.

Every effort will be made to ensure Things and activities remain
current, but please submit an issue if you
discover a broken link or have suggestions for a more recent example.

## Ideas for reusing these materials

The possibilities are endless! The materials developed for the 23
(research data) Things program can be used however you wish. Some ideas
and suggestions are below:

### Self-directed learning activity

Individuals or small groups can work through the program at their own
pace.

-   Step through the 23 ‘Things’
-   Have a choice of three learning activities for each Thing: Getting
    started, Learn more or Challenge me
-   Do all 23 or 'cherry pick’ the Things you most need to know or have
    an interest in

### Customise Things for different audiences

-   Change the activity links to showcase your data services
-   Select a few Things that could be offered as a 1 hour workshop
-   Adapt Things for specific audiences and discipline

### Run your own short courses

The materials and resources you need are in the [training materials](#training-materials-for-reuse)
section. Run some short courses for your work group, new inductees or
other groups at your institution.

-   Crash course covers the first 12 Things: can be run in three hours
-   Sprint to the finish covers Things 13 - 23: can be run in three
    hours

#### Shorter sessions:

-   Things 1-8: excellent introduction to the basic concepts
-   Things 9-16: valuable for those who need more in-depth information
-   Things 17-22: more technically focused for those wanting to
    understand how tools, apps and APIs support data

If you have questions or comments about any of the Things you can share
them by Tweeting to
[@andsdata](http://www.twitter.com/@andsdata "ANDS on Twitter") or in
the Google+ [Data Librarians
Group](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/105455769899183786145).

responses that can be used to quickly and succinctly pitch research data
management to researchers. The responses can be contextualised to suit
what is available at your organisation. This resource is mentioned in

## Examples of reuse

### **Topic specific workshops**

-   E.g. sensitive data using [Thing
    9](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/all23/thing-9 "Thing 9")
    and [Thing
    10](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/all23/thing-10 "Thing 10")
    or data citation with [Thing

--------------------------------------------------

Adapt, don’t just adopt. Customising and contextualising is key. Use
examples from your data catalogues, your policies and services, and your
key webpages.

Resources
---------

Our [resources
page](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/resources "resources")

<div id="new_content_container_582534_582534">

Incentives {#incentives}
----------

23 is a big number and even if you cherry pick and ignore things of no
interest to your group you may need a little help to keep the enthusiasm
going.

-   [Strategies to keep you or your group motivated (PDF, 0.39
    MB)](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/590606/Incentive_startegies.pdf "Incentives")

### Credly badges

Credly badges will continue to be available for each Thing. Badges can
be a great motivator - and they are a simple reward. Individuals can
claim a digital badge for each Thing they complete. These can be
attached to your LinkedIn profile, blog site or other social media to
show the world you are data savvy. Claim them via the link from each
Thing page.

### Reward stickers

Group or course leaders can award or distribute [badge
stickers](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/resources#credly)
to participants in their group or course. The stickers can be worn,
stuck to the 23 (research data) Things poster, or used to track progress
on a leaderboard. It’s up to you! [Email
us](mailto:guides@ands.org.au?subject=Credly%20badge%20stickers) if
you’d like sticker pages posted out to you, or print them yourself using
the [sticker
template](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/resources).

### Professional and personal development (PD) eg KPIs, ALIA PD

Talk to your manager about doing or running a form of the 23 (research
data) Things program as part of your work plan. Could it form part of
your professional appraisal?

ALIA members can claim Professional Development Points for participating
in 23 (research data) Things - one point per hour from the Informal
Learning Category (this category has a maximum claim amount of 30 points
per PD year). If this has whet your appetite, take a look at ALIA’s
[Research/Academic
Specialisation](https://www.alia.org.au/alia-pd-scheme-researchacademic-specialisation)
(ALIA members only) that incorporates research data management.
