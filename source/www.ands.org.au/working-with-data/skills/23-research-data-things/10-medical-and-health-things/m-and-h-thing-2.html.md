Research data is critical to solving the big questions of our time. So
what are some of the issues we face in managing research data?

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0007/584845/Activity-1-button.png){#t2-activity1 width="145" height="46"} Considerations in data management
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research data is for everyone. Governments and Universities all around
Australia and the world are now encouraging researchers to better manage
their data so others can use it.

Research data might be critical to solving the big questions of our
time, but so much data are being lost or poorly managed.

1.  Take just a minute and browse over some ways [Queensland Government
    Data](https://data.qld.gov.au/article/case-studies "Queensland government data")
    is being used by businesses, families, travellers, farmers.
2.  This 4.40mins [cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66oNv_DJuPc)
    put together by the New York University Health Sciences Library, is
    about what happens when a researcher hasn't managed their data (at
    all). What could possibly go wrong?!
3.  As you watch the cartoon jot down the data management mistakes which
    interest or appall you.
4.  Now, scan through the dot points in the 'Consider the following'
    section of the University of the Sunshine Coast's
    [LibGuide](http://libguides.usc.edu.au/researchdata) which provides
    advice for researchers on how to manage their data.

**Consider** how just ONE of the data disasters depicted in the cartoon
could have been avoided.

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0008/584846/Activity-2-button.png){#t2-activity2 width="145" height="46"} How do you manage “Big Data”?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'Big Data' is a term we're hearing with increasing frequency. Data
management for Big Data brings much complexity - citing dynamic data,
software, high volume computing, storage costs, transfer of petabytes of
data, preservation, provenance, and more.

1.  Genomics is an area where dramatically increasing amounts of data
    are being created each year. **** Watch this video [*Genomics and
    the human health
    sector*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DXqxNhnFUI) (2:34mins)
    about how genomics data can lead to accurate, timely and effective
    solutions in healthcare.
2.  Read [this short
    article](https://www.mcri.edu.au/news/25-million-grant-prepare-australia-genomics-medicine-revolution)
    about Australia’s leading role in integrating genomics into
    healthcare.

“Genomics is a four-headed beast; considering the computational demands
across the lifecycle of a dataset - acquisition, storage, distribution,
and analysis - genomics is either on par with or the most demanding of
the Big Data domains.” Stephens ZD, Lee SY,
Faghri  F, Campbell  RH,  Zhai C, Efron MJ, et al. (2015) *Big Data:
Astronomical or Genomical?* PLoS Biol 13(7): e1002195.
[doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1002195](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002195)

3.  Read this post and presentation titled: ["*Big Data: The 5Vs
    Everyone Must
    Know*](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140306073407-64875646-big-data-the-5-vs-everyone-must-know)*”.*
    This article uses 5V's: volume, variety, velocity, veracity and
    value as a concept for how big data can be managed more
    successfully.

**Consider** whether the concept of 5Vs is useful to support better
management and reuse of genomics 'big data'.

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0009/584847/Activity-3-button.png){#t2-activity3 width="145" height="46"} From analog to digital with eLab Notebooks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Laboratory Notebooks are used by researchers to formally record their
lab based research activities. As research has become increasingly
digital and collaborative the utility of traditional hard copy Lab
Notebooks has been challenged. Not surprisingly then, eLab Notebooks
(ELN) have emerged as an alternative.

Effective data management for constantly updated data, such as that
within ELNs, is a real challenge for projects who wish to publish their
data during the project.

1.  Read this [short
    definition](https://www.gurdon.cam.ac.uk/institute-life/computing/elnguidance "Electronic Lab Notebooks - for prospective users")
    of ELNs;
2.  Then read the article [*International team of scientists open
    sources search for malaria
    cure*](https://opensource.com/life/14/6/international-team-open-sources-search-malaria-cure)
    ** about how an international team of scientists and citizen
    scientists are using open source ELNs to speed up a cure for
    malaria. You can access their [open
    ELNs](http://malaria.ourexperiment.org/). Click on on Matthew Todd's
    ELN to see what it's in it.

**Consider** a data management issue and possible solutions, where data
is generated, stored and shared via an open ELN.
