Citation analysis and citation metrics are important to the academic
community. Find out where data fits in the citation picture.

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0007/584845/Activity-1-button.png){#t7-activity1 width="145" height="46"} Getting more out of your citation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data citation continues the tradition of acknowledging other people’s
work and ideas. Along with books, journals and other scholarly works, it
is now possible to formally cite research datasets and even the software
that was used to create or analyse the data.

1\. Have a look at this dataset from the [Australian Longitudinal Study
of Aging](http://www.ada.edu.au/ada/01083-wave1). Data Citations are
available from the Thomson Reuters [Data Citation
Index](http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/)- note
the number of times this dataset has been
cited.![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0007/589300/webofscience.png){width="100%"}\
2. Scan through the ANDS introduction to[data
citation](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/citation-and-identifiers/data-citation "data citation")

3\. Now look at the[Hutchinson Drought
Index](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/monthly-drought-australia-drought-index/61872)
data record in Research Data Australia.

1.  This research data makes cross disciplinary connections [between
    episodes of drought and correlated increases in rural mental health
    issues](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/35/13950).
2.  The beauty of this record is that it shows the entirety of the
    research outputs - publications, software, related datasets and
    more - all of which are citable.
3.  Click on the ‘Cite’ button to see the similarities between the
    formats for citation of data and other scholarly publications. Did
    you notice that, as yet, there are no citation metrics to this
    record?

**Consider:** Data citation is a relatively new concept in the scholarly
landscape and as yet, is not routinely done by researchers, or expected
by most journals. What could be done to encourage routine citation of
research data and software associated with research outputs?

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0008/584846/Activity-2-button.png){#t7-activity2 width="145" height="46"} Data Citation Principles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Force11 Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles are based on
the premise that data citation, like the citation of other evidence and
sources, is good research practice and is part of the scholarly
ecosystem supporting data reuse.

Since they were published in 2014, the Principles have been endorsed by
numerous individuals and more than 100 data centres, publishers and
societies.

1.  Start by reading the [Force11
    Principles](https://www.force11.org/group/joint-declaration-data-citation-principles-final)
2.  Then browse the list of people and organisations that [have endorsed
    the Principles](https://www.force11.org/datacitation/endorsements)

**Consider:** Given such support and clear direction, why do you think
data citation has not been uniformly adopted, so far, across all
disciplines?
