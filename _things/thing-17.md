## Getting started
### Building data literacy - what can you do?

We all have a role to play in building a world of data literate
citizens.

### DIY to build your own data literacy

Technical data wrangling skills are fast becoming a new form of data
literacy.  The four Carpentry concepts have really taken off over the
past couple of years.

The “hour a week” for 23 (rd) Things doesn’t allow time to do any of the
Carpentry modules (most need a couple of hours to complete) but here’s a
chance to find out what all the Carpentry buzz is about.

Have a look at [this Environmental
scan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZASH-NhsvXnyZNJkGzFNFp5_adn6Q-iX2N-tbv1Apbw/edit#gid=0)
of courses offering data skills. Then [choose 1 Carpentry to explore in
depth or browse over them

1.  [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org)
2.  [Library Carpentry](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/about/)
3.  [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)
4.  [Author
    Carpentry](https://authorcarpentry.github.io/ "Author carpentry")

We will get more hands-on with Carpentry in Thing 21

**Consider:** your ideas or experience about the value of the various
Carpentry courses.
