## Getting started
### Metadata: describing research data

Metadata is your best data friend. Metadata is structured information
about a resource that describes characteristics such as content,
quality, format, location and contact information. Creating metadata to
describe research data is very similar to the process for descriptive
cataloguing of library resources.

Metadata schema are sets of metadata elements (or fields) for describing
a particular type of information resource. Numerous metadata schema
exist for describing research data across different disciplines.
Probably our most familiar metadata schema are those commonly used in
library catalogues and publication repositories such as MARC and Dublin
Core.

1\. Start by reading the ANDS [Introduction to
Metadata](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/metadata) to
understand what metadata is and why it is the lifeblood of research data
sharing.\
\
2. Now look closely at this good quality metadata record for research
data: [Long-term variation of surface phytoplankton chlorophyll a in the
Southern Ocean during
1965-2002](http://gcmd.nasa.gov/KeywordSearch/Metadata.do?Portal=amd_au&KeywordPath=Parameters%7CCLIMATE+INDICATORS%7CATMOSPHERIC%26%2347%3BOCEAN+INDICATORS%7CTELECONNECTIONS%7CANTARCTIC+OSCILLATION&OrigMetadataNode=AADC&EntryId=chlorophyll_65-02&MetadataView=Full&MetadataType=0&lbnode=mdlb3).Why
do you think this record is considered ‘high quality’? **Hint:**
consider both the type and quality of information provided. What
metadata included in this record help discovery and reuse of the data?
Look back at the ANDS Introduction to Metadata for ideas and think about
previous Things such as licensing and sensitive data.

3\. **If you have time:** Sadly, it’s not hard to find examples of low
quality metadata describing research data. Read this short two page
article [Avoiding Data Dumpsters - Toward Equitable and Useful Data
Sharing](http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp1605148) on the power
of good quality, schema-compliant metadata (N Engl J Med. 374 2016 May
11. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMp1605148).

**Consider:** Why, if metadata is the lifeblood of data discoverability
and reuse, is it often neglected or not richly done when data is
published?

### Well Done! You are halfway through\
- Now take some time to reflect

Go back over any notes that you may have made as you went through the
Things

Consider:

-   Why you are doing 23things - are you achieving this?
-   Let us know on the [Data Librarians Google+
    page](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/105455769899183786145 "Data Librarians Google+ page")
    if you are achieving your desired outcomes, have discovered new
    things you didn't think you would, found that data is your "thing",
    or just reflect on your journey so far

### Metadata schema and standards

A metadata standard is a schema that has been formally approved and
published, with governance procedures in place to maintain and update
the standard. Examples include ANZLIC (Australia and New Zealand Spatial
Information Council) and DDI (Document, Discover and Interoperate).

Numerous metadata standards exist and the standard chosen to describe
resources such as research data should be appropriate to the project or
discipline.

1\. Start by reading this short guide to [Selecting a metadata
standard](https://web.archive.org/web/20120211163323/http://marinemetadata.org/guides/mdatastandards/standardselect "Evaluating and selecting a metadata standard").
Keep this Guide open.

2\. Choose one disciplinary standard which sparks your interest from the
UK Digital Curation Centre’s [Directory of Disciplinary
Metadata](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/metadata-standards "DCC Directory of Disciplinary metadata").
Use the Guide above to critique your chosen standard.

**Consider:** other reasons to recommend (or not) the particular
standard you explored in detail.

### Tools for creating metadata

We couldn't decide on a single activity for Thing 11, so you get to
choose between two!

**Option 1: Hands on with ANZLIC**

-   requires you to install open source ANZMet Lite metadata entry tool
-   Is a hands-on experience in creating an ANZLIC compliant metadata
    record
-   [Go to Option
    1](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/all23/thing-11/thing-11-challenge-me-options#option1)

**Option 2: Hands on with XML**

-   does not require you to install software
-   Is a hands-on experience with XML and may help prepare you for Thing
    13 (Crosswalks)
-   [Go to Option
    2](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/all23/thing-11/thing-11-challenge-me-options#option2)

**Consider:** the metadata creation tools we have explored in Thing 11 -
what needs to happen for these tools to have much wider uptake?
