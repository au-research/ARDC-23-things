Data descriptor, keyword, subject … these are all terms commonly used
when discussing metadata.  Learn about the use of controlled
vocabularies to enhance data discovery.

{% include start.md text="Controlled vocabularies for data description" %}

In addition to selecting a metadata standard or schema, whenever
possible you should also use a controlled vocabulary. A controlled
vocabulary provides a consistent way to describe data - location, time,
place name, and subject.

Controlled vocabularies significantly improve data discovery. It makes
data more shareable with researchers in the same discipline because
everyone is ‘talking the same language’ when searching for specific data
e.g. plants, animals, medical conditions, places etc

1\. Start by browsing [Controlling your Language: a Directory of Metadata
Vocabularies](http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20160101151732/http://www.jiscdigitalmedia.ac.uk/guide/controlling-your-language-links-to-metadata-vocabularies "Control your language")
from JISC in the UK. Make sure you scroll down to *5. Conclusion* - it’s
worth a read.

2\. We are going to see some controlled vocabularies in action in
the Atlas of Living Australia. We are going to use the [Species Search](https://bie.ala.org.au/ "ALA"): type *text:magpie* in
the search box. Choose your favourite magpie species and click on the red *View Records* button under the occurrence records map. Pick a record and click on the
*View record* link. Any metadata field where you see
*Supplied...* tells you that the information supplied by the person who
submitted the record (often a 'citizen scientist') has been changed to
the controlled vocabulary being used in metadata fields e.g. Observer,
Record date and Common name.

**If you have time**: have a browse around the stunning level of data
description and data contained in the [Atlas of Living
Australia](http://www.ala.org.au/ "ALA").

**Consider:** How do you think we could encourage people to use
controlled vocabularies in their data descriptions?

{% include learn.md text="What controlled vocabularies exist?" %}

Think about (or find out!) what standard vocabularies are used, or could
be used, by research groups in a discipline which interests you. Note
there may be more than one vocabulary used in a discipline.

1\. Choose a vocabulary and determine if it would be of use to people
working in a specific field. Try the University of North Carolina’s
[Metadata Tutorial](http://guides.lib.unc.edu/c.php?g=8749&p=44502) to
browse for discipline and general vocabularies.

2\. Research Vocabularies Australia (RVA) is a service that helps you
find, access, and reuse vocabularies for research. Go to the [RVA
Portal](https://vocabs.ands.org.au/), use  and see if your chosen
vocabulary is included.

**Consider:** why your vocabulary should (or shouldn't) be included in
RVA.

{% include challenge.md text="Supporting multiple vocabularies" %}

The Science Keyword Aggregator has been developed by CSIRO and released
as open source to allow others to adapt and reuse. It is a service that
allows users to search for defined keywords across a range of managed
vocabularies.

A widget that uses the service is also available for system owners to
embed in their application and thus provide a term search there.

1.  Start by viewing the [metadata
    record](https://data.csiro.au/dap/landingpage?pid=csiro:15631 "KWA metadata record")
    describing the Keyword Aggregator (KWA) noting the rich description
    e.g. links to the source code and related materials.
2.  Now go to the [Science KWA](http://scikey.org/) to read more about
    the KWA and try out the [widget](http://scikey.org/page/widget).
3.  Then take a look at the [service
    documentation](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/VOCAB/Keyword+Aggregator+Web+Service+Documentation)
    for the KWA web service.

**Consider:** Is this a tool that could be implemented in your
organisation? How would you use it?
