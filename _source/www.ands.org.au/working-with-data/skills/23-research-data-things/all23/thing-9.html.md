**Thing 9: Licensing data for reuse**

**Getting started:Â **Why license research data?

</div>

<div id="new_content_container_478377">

<div id="content_container_433212">

Consider this scenario: Youâve found a dataset you (or your client) is
interested in.Â Â Youâve downloaded it. Excellent!Â Â But do you know what
you (or your client) can and cannot do with the data?Â Â TheÂ answer lies
in data licensing.Â Â Licensing is critical to enabling data to be reused
and cited.

1.  Start by reading this [brief
    introduction](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/publishing-and-reusing-data/licensing-for-reuse)
    to licensing research data.\
    **For our colleagues in New Zealand**, find out about data licensing
    in NZ at
    [NZGOAL](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/)
2.  Now have a closer look at the
    [poster](http://creativecommons.org.au/content/LicencePoster_Sep20151.pdf)
    from creativecommons.org.Â Â Click on the descriptions for more
    information.Â Â Notice they have used CC BY as the licensing
    information at the bottom of the poster so you know what you can do
    withÂ the poster itself.

**Consider:** If you were considering licensing a dataset on something
which may have commercial value to others - what license would you
apply?

Enabling reuse of data can speed up research and innovation.Â Â Licensing
is critical to enabling data reuse.

1.  Start by watching this 4.30mins
    [video](https://youtu.be/LmyzF7iJp3E?list=PLG25fMbdLRa7QH8_yyNSgzkQOTBVsTK2r)
    in which Dr Kevin Cullen from the University of New South Wales
    explains their approach to licensing which aims to strengthen the
    Universityâs relationship with business and industry.\
    **For our NZ colleagues:** choose a video or two from [NZGOAL
    training video
    playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKAGOg1JYnPntUL_WE2evkt-jLY2Ng2bB) -
    you might be particularly interested in [Training Video 11 NZGOAL,
    Creative Commons and
    Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFOIsTgbKzg&index=11&list=PLKAGOg1JYnPntUL_WE2evkt-jLY2Ng2bB).
2.  Now read the[Australian Government Public Data Policy
    Statement](https://www.dpmc.gov.au/sites/default/files/publications/aust_govt_public_data_policy_statement_1.pdf "Australian Government Public Data policy statement")
    (2 pages) that was released by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in
    December 2015.Â Â Note in particular, the last dot point.
3.  Have a look at the [Research Data Rights Management
    Guide](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/research-data-rights-management "research data Rights Management Guide").
    Take particular note of the three flowcharts, and think about the
    different licensing obligations for rights holders, data users and
    data suppliers.\

    **Consider:** possible implications for data managers, researchers,
    librarians and others as we move forward with the [National Science
    and Innovation Agenda](http://www.innovation.gov.au/page/agenda)?\
    \
    Does your institution have a policy or guidelines around data
    licensing?

**Challenge me:Â **Data licensing in practice

</div>

<div id="new_content_container_478664">

<div id="content_container_433220">

Not all research data that is shared is licensed for reuse. It should
be!

1.  Start by going to [Research Data
    Australia](https://researchdata.ands.org.au) and search for research
    data using keywords eg. âwater qualityâ or âcancerâ.Â Â Note the
    number of records in your result set.
2.  Now âRefine Resultsâ to limit your search to only those datasets
    with an âopenâ licence.Â Â Note the number of records in this result
    set.
3.  Look closely at the specific Licensing information on a small sample
    of those records with âopenâ licences. How easy or difficult it is
    to work out if the data can or canât be reused e.g. for commercial
    purposes? with international collaborators?

**Consider:** Assigning Open Licenses is not routine. Suggest one tip
for encouraging uptake of 'open' licensing.
