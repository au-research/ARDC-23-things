-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research data comes in many shapes and sizes. Kick off your research
data journey and start sharing your stories.

-   **Getting started** is for you if you are just beginning to learn
    about research data
-   **Learn more** is if you know a bit but want to know more
-   **Challenge me** is often more technical or assumes that you are
    familiar with at least the basics of managing and wrangling research
    data.

**Do I have to do them all?** No - you can pick'n'mix a different stream
each week, or stay in the one stream. You can do as much or as little as
you want to do, or need to know.

[Thing 2: Issues in research data management](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/all23/thing-2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research data is critical to solving the big questions of our time.Â Â So
what are some of the issues we face in managing research data?

-   **Getting started:** Watch a cartoon about what happens when a
    researcher hasn't managed their data (at allâ¦) What could possibly
    go wrong!?
-   **Learn more:** the 5Vs about Big Data everyone must know
-   **Challenge me:** what are the issues when data is part of an eLab
    Notebook?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Data and its management change over time.Â Â Here we look at data and
research lifecycles and make connections between them.

-   **Getting started:** follow the pink circles around the data
    lifecycle
-   **Learn more:** how would you modify a Lifecycle model for your
    institution?
-   **Challenge me:** share the current emerging opportunities for
    institutions to integrate management systems for your research data
    assets

Repositories and portals play an important role in making research data
discoverable and accessible.

-   **Getting started:** explore Research Data Australia to find
    research data
-   **Learn more:** what's in (and what's not in) the 2,000+ data
    repositories in re3data?
-   **Challenge me:** can we Trust that repository and how would we
    know?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research data may be shared in many ways.Â Â This week we look at 3 ways:

1.  **Getting started** looks at sharing data via access methods: Open,
    Shared and Closed Data
2.  **Learn more** explores data sharing trends of some countries and by
    disciplines
3.  **Challenge me** dips into ensuring that data can be shared for a
    long time via some preservation tools

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ensuring data stays accessible and reusable into the future.Â Â Learn
about the curation of dataÂ and try out a free tool for managing file
formats.

1.  **Getting started:** how would you advise someone what to do to make
    sure their fragile born digital data is robust and long lived?
2.  **Learn more:** how does archiving, preserving and curating data
    "Stack"Â up?
3.  **Challenge me:** what's in a (PRO)NOM?

Citation analysis and citation metrics are important to the academic
community. Find out where data fits in the citation picture.

-   **Getting started**: how to cite data
-   **Learn more**: may the FORCE(11) be with you (while you cite data)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What are Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and how do they support data
citation and metrics for data and related research objects?

-   **Getting started**: what are DOIs and why are they critical for
    accurate citation metrics?
-   **Learn more**: delves into altmetrics (and donuts!)
-   **Challenge me**: what about minting DOIs for software, algorithms
    and grey literature?

**Did you know?** You don't need to do all three streams, or even stay
in the same stream.Â 23 Things is about picking which Things and streams
you want to explore or know more about.
