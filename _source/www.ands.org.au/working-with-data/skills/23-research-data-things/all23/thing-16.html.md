#### Thing 16: What are publishers and funders saying about data?

Two choices for Thing 16!

Two exciting things are happening with data and journal publishers. More
and more journal publishers are asking authors to make the
dataÂ underpinning a journal article available.Â And, new forms of data
publishing are emerging: data journals.

![publishers with data
policies](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0007/543616/funders-slide.png)

Itâs all about ensuring that the research being described in the article
is based on solid, reproducible science. Thinking back to [Thing 5: Data
Sharing](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/all23/thing-5 "Thing 5"),
remember that *available* can be âopenâ or âsharedâ through mediated
access.

### **Choice 1: Journal data policies**

More and more publishers are suggesting, asking and even mandating that
underpinning data be available to support journal articles.Â Choose one
of the links below to explore some of these policies.

1.  PLOS One [data
    policy](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability)
2.  [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/pages/jdap "Dryad") is an data
    repository which integrates data and articles.Â It lists how and when
    to submit your data for 111 journals
3.  Look up a journal you know and see what the advice the journal gives
    on related data

**Consider:** How easy, or hard, it was for you to understand what you
had to do in regard to research data?

### **Choice 2: Data journals**

Explore a new form of data publishing: the data journal. Data journals
focus on data, rather than discuss an analysis of the data (as in
traditional journals).

1.  Read this short introduction: [What are data
    journals?](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/publishing-and-reusing-data/data-journals#dj "Data and Journals")
2.  Browse this [data paper](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201647)
    published in Natureâs data journal:Â *Scientific Data,* on how and
    why the Chinese population has been on the move in the past 70
    years. Note the extensive exposure of the data through maps, links
    to full tables, and diagrams etc. and how to cite this article.
    Clicking on the DOI under *Data Citations* will take you to the
    actual data described in the article.

**Consider:** Why do you think authors might choose to share their data
in data journals rather than, or in addition to, traditional journal
formats?

#### Thing 16: What are publishers and funders saying about data?

The number of funders, journals/publishers and institutions implementing
a research data policy is growing. However the landscape is complex and
implications of policies for researchers can be unclear.

1.  Start by reading about global publisher Springer Natureâs
    introduction of a standardisation research data policy framework
    with four data policy types by reading this blog post, [Over 600
    Springer Nature journals commit to new data sharing
    policies](http://group.springernature.com/gb/group/media/press-releases/over-600-springer-nature-journals-commit-to-new-data-sharing-policies/11111248).Â Â 
2.  Learn about international efforts to standardise journal data
    policies through the Research Data Alliance [Interest Group on Data
    Policy Standardisation and
    Implementation](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-policy-standardisation-and-implementation)

**Consider:** [ your top three pieces of advice for a young researcher
aiming to publish in one of the Springer journals which has a Type 3 or
Type 4 data sharing policy.

#### Thing 16: What are publishers and funders saying about data?

The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)
funded more than \$896 million (2015) for health and medical research
including 1030 new grants to universities, medical research institutions
and hospitals across Australia.

1\. Start by reading the [NHMRC Open Access
Policy](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/research/nhmrc_open_access_policy_15_january_2018_v2.pdf "NHMRC Open Access Policy")
(section 3.2 and Appendix 2) and note the lifecycle diagram for data
sharing.

2\. Then choose one of these major funders of research overseas and have
a look at their data sharing policies:

-   [National Science
    Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp) in the US,
    and note the Data Management Plan requirement (see [Thing 15:
    DMPs](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/all23/thing-15 "Thing 15"))
-   [Wellcome
    Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/policy-data-management-and-sharing)
    in the UK (1 page)

Now, imagine it is 2020â¦ **consider** what you think Australian research
funders will be requiring of researchers who are seeking project
funding. What does this mean for those working in data support areas?
