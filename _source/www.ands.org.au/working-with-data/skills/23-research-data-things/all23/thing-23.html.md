There are over 90 Australian courses offering data related units in
Information Science, Health, Business, IT, Engineering, Science, and
more. Data courses are offered across a range of Universities, at
undergraduate and postgraduate levels, online and on campus - something
for everyone.

Sometimes there are individual data units offered within a discipline
degree, others have a number of electives or majors. Some courses
specifically in Data Management are also available

e.g.Â **Charles Sturt University**[**Graduate Certificate and Masters
Specialisation in Data
Management**](http://www.csu.edu.au/infostudies/ "Graduate Certificate and Masters Specialisation in Data Management")

From 2017 onwards the School of Information Studies at Charles Sturt
University will be offering a Graduate Certificate in Data Management
(GCDM). As practicing information professionals or researchers, formal
study in Data Management will enable you to demonstrate you can fill an
identified professional skill and knowledge gap. Completion of the GCDM
qualification provides evidence you have studied the fundamental
principles, key concepts, tools, standards, and techniques of data
curation and data management.

The GCDM will comprise of four subjects â the first three subjects are
core and are:

-   INF461 Introduction to Data Management: Governance, Standards and
    Ethics;
-   INF462 Data Curation; and,
-   INF463 Introduction to Data Tools and Analytics.

For the 4^th^ subject, students are offered a choice of either:

-   INF449 Research Data Management; or,
-   INF522 Project Management in Information Agencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You don't have to have done all the 23 Things - 23T was about your
learning, not completing all 23, whatever number of Things you did is
fine.

It's time to reflect on what you did, what you learned and what you got
out of the time you spent doing some or all of the 23 (research data)
Things.

Write a reflection on your learning and include it in your PD interview
with your supervisor.
