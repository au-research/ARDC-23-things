Repositories and portals play an important role in making research data
discoverable and accessible.

-   **Getting started:** explore Research Data Australia to find
    research data
-   **Learn more:** what's in (and what's not in) the 2,000+ data
    repositories in re3data?
-   **Challenge me:** can we Trust that repository and how would we
    know?

<div id="new_content_container_429978_429978">

<div id="content_container_413286_413286">

#### Thing 4: Data discovery

Repositories enable discovery of data by publishing data descriptions
("metadata") about the data they hold - like a library catalogue
describes the materials held in a library.Â Â Most repositories provide
access to the data itself, but not always.

Data portals or aggregators draw together research data records from a
number of repositories. eg Research Data Australia (RDA) aggregates
records from over 100 Australian repositories.

1.  Click on this RDA record from the Australian Antarctic Data Centre:
    [Weddell seals in
    Antarctica](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/measuring-effects-human-leptonychotes-weddellii/699460 "Weddell Seals")
2.  Have a close look at the record to see the ways the Australian
    Antarctic Division has made this record discoverable and
    accessible.Â Â Note how many times this dataset has been cited and how
    to cite this data.Â Â We will look at data citation in more detail in
    Thing 7.
3.  Spend a few minutes exploring RDA.
    1.  Try
        [browsing](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/subjects "Browse subjects in Research Data Australia")
        or searching on a topic of interest.
    2.  See [which
        institutions](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/contributors "Research Data Australia - contributors")
        contribute metadata records to RDA.
    3.  Explore a record or two in depth.

**Consider:** the future impact of having a national research data
catalogue.

#### Thing 4: Data discovery

What data repositories exist and how are Australian researchers sharing
their data?

-   Start by going to [re3data.org](http://www.re3data.org/)
-   Click on Browse &gt; By Country &gt; click on Australia in the map
-   There are 87 repositories listed for Australia. Does this represent
    all the research data repositories Australia has to offer? Is
    anything missing?

**Consider:** one idea for how you think improved discovery of
Australia's research data repositories, and the data records they
contain, could be achieved.

#### Thing 4: Data discovery

What makes a "good" data repository?

Finding a data repository to suit your needs requires careful evaluation
of the options available in order to make an informed choice.

Have a look at one or both of these resources:

1.  [DCC checklist for evaluating data
    repositories](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides-checklists/where-keep-research-data "DCC checklist for evaluating repositories")
2.  [CoreTrustSeal Data Repositories
    Requirements](https://www.coretrustseal.org/why-certification/requirements/ "Core Trust Seal")

**Consider:** your experiences or thoughts on evaluating data
repositories: have you used either or both of these resources? Would
you?
