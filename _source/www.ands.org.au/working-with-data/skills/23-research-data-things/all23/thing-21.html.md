#### Thing 21: Tools of the (dirty data) trade

Data horror stories: how did it happen?

Why is "cleanâ data important? Public policy, changes to medical
protocols and economic decisions all depend on accurate and complete
data. Thing 21 looks at the why and what of âdirty data.â

1.  Pregnant men? Yes! Read some [real data horror
    stories](http://www.relevategroup.com/blog/dirty-data-horror-stories-â-when-good-data-goes-bad "When good data goes bad: blog")
    about dirty data.
2.  How does data get dirty in the first place? This [short
    video](http://aspcapro.org/resource/saving-lives-research-data/gis-video-what-makes-data-dirty "ASAPCA video")
    (5 min) from the ASPCA (American Society for Prevention of Cruelty
    to Animals) shows simply how incomplete, inaccurate data can occur.
    You can imagine how the resultant problems would multiply
    exponentially the bigger the dataset.
3.  Browse down the [Bad Data
    Guide's](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide "Bad data guide")
    list of commonly encountered data quality issues (with possible
    solutions). This list is aimed at journalists but it shows who is
    responsible for cleaning up dirty data. The [Bad Data
    Handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024422.do#tab_04_2 "Bad Data handbook")
    also contains views of experts and practitioners in this area.

Click into a few of the causes and solutions to dirty data - many of us
contribute information to reports or do our home accounts in
spreadsheets, and maybe itâs time to think about how clean our own data
is.

**If you have time**: for a quick guide to working with spreadsheets,
check out one of the School of Dataâs [Data Fundamentals
course](http://schoolofdata.org/courses/#DataFundamentals). The modules
use real data from e.g. the World Bank.

**Consider:** the wide ranging implications of how dirty data can impact
on your life.

#### Thing 21: Tools of the (dirty data) trade

How often have you found some data that looks interesting, but theyâre
in PDFs or on a webpageâ¦ how do you get the data into spreadsheets so
you can work with them?

The School of Data has fantastic, easy to follow tutorials working with
real data.

**Option 1:**

Letâs start extracting tabular data from text-based PDFs. The
[Extracting Data From
PDFs](http://schoolofdata.org/extracting-data-from-pdfs/) module
provides a brief overview of the different techniques used to extract
data from PDFs, with a focus on introducing Tabula, a free open-source
tool build for this specific task.

1.  Get ready: go to [Extracting Data From
    PDFs](http://schoolofdata.org/extracting-data-from-pdfs/)
    1.  Download the correct version of Tabula for your operating
        system, and java runtime if required
    2.  note this tutorial doesnât work on scanned pdfs
2.  Work through as much of the Tabula tutorial as you can and remember
    this tutorial for the next time you get a PDF with valuable (and
    hard-to-extract) data.

**Option 2:**

As much as we wish everything was available in CSV or the format of our
choice â most data on the web is published in different forms. How do
you extract data from HTML? Use a Scraper.

1.  Got to [Making data on the web useful:
    scraping](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/scraping/) and
    follow the two ârecipesâ to learn code-free Scraping in 5-10 minutes
    using Google Spreadsheets & Google Chrome

(Note: Use the Google Chrome Extension âScraper, by dvhtnâ)

A warning about web scraping: some websites have strict terms and
conditions on the use of their content. In case of copyrighted
materials, a user must obtain permission from copyright holders to reuse
materials.

**If you have time or just love data dabbling:**

Extracting data from PDFs will inevitably result in some dirty data
creeping into your
[dataset](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/data-cleaning/#sthash.O6t7fVMJ.dpuf).
The School of Data have some really interesting [Data
Cleansing](http://schoolofdata.org/courses/#IntroDataCleaning) modules.
****

**Consider:Â **strategies for encouraging data to be published in more
re-usable formats rather than PDF.

#### Thing 21: Tools of the (dirty data) trade

OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a valuable open source tool that
is similar to Excel but more powerful. You can use it to: record data;
manipulate data; clean up dirty data; and to transform datasets.

**Option 1: If you are new to OpenRefine**

1.  Start by watching[introduction to
    OpenRefine](https://youtu.be/B70J_H_zAWM) (6 .48mins) to learn how
    it can be used to clean up messy data.
2.  Now get hands on!Â Â You will need to download OpenRefine and the
    dataset for this activity. Work your way through as much as [this
    tutorial](http://www.andrewbatran.com/datastorytelling/openrefine/)
    as you can. The sections covering Facets and Transforming Values
    will give you a flavour for what the OpenRefine tool offers.

**Option 2: if youâre already familiar with OpenRefine and might be
ready to share what you know**

Take a look through the lesson materials used to teach OpenRefine in
either:

1.  OpenRefine in [Library
    Carpentry](https://github.com/LibraryCarpentry/week-four-library-carpentry/blob/master/lesson-materials/Basic-OpenRefine-functions-I.md)
2.  OpenRefine in [Data Carpentry for
    Ecology](http://www.datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/)

**Consider:** Carpentry course Trainers and Helpers are often in high
demand. Would you consider becoming a trainer to teach tools such as
Open Refine?
