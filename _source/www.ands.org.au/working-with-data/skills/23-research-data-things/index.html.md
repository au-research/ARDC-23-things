23 (research data) Things is here, now, for you!
------------------------------------------------

Anyone can do [23 (research data)
Things](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/all23 "23 Things")
at any time.  Do them all, do some, cherry-pick the Things you need or
want to know about. Do them on your own, or get together a Group and
share the learning.  The program is intended to be flexible, adaptable
and fun!

Each of the 23 Things offers a variety of learning opportunities with
activities at three levels of complexity: ‘Getting started’, ‘Learn
more’ and ‘Challenge me’. All resources used in the program are online
and free to use.

The 23 Things are designed to build knowledge as the program progresses,
so if you’re new to the wonderful world of research data management, we
suggest you start with Things 1-3 and then decide where you want to go
from there.

What is 23 (research data) Things?
----------------------------------

23 (research data) Things is self-directed learning for anybody who
wants to know more about research data. "Things" is a neat concept for
creating packaged content on any topic.

23 (research data) Things is an adaptation of previous 23 Things
programs including:

-   23 Things for Web 2.0 developed by Helene Blowers at Charlotte
    Mecklneburg Library
-   23 Research Things @ Melbourne 2014 developed by The University of
    Melbourne
-   [23 Things: Libraries for Research
    Data](https://b2share.eudat.eu/api/files/24b4d6a7-98db-4f50-8ee1-f1a1b652fb42/23Things_Libraries_For_Research_Data_en.pdf "23Things: Libraries for research data")
    developed by the [Libraries for Research Data Interest
    Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/libraries-research-data.html "Libraries for research data interest group")
    of the Research Data Alliance.

Repurposing 23 (research data) Things
-------------------------------------

-   [Top 10 Health and Medical
    Things](http://www.ands.org.au/partners-and-communities/23-research-data-things/10-medical-and-health-things "10 Health")
    is an opportunity to explore issues surrounding management of
    research data, specifically for people working with medical,
    clinical and health data.
-   [23 (research data) Things re-purpose
    toolkit](http://www.ands.org.au/partners-and-communities/23-research-data-things/toolkit "Repurpose toolkit")
    is now available. You can:
    -   adapt it for your situation
    -   adopt it as suggested training for all staff
    -   contextualise it for your discipline
    -   extend or contract it to meet your specific research data
        knowledge needs

Things: online and hands-on workshop exercises
----------------------------------------------

"Things" are a useful format for covering a range of concepts in short
courses, or for do-it-yourself online training. Use the exercises as
they are in your training and teaching, encourage people to cherry pick
things they want to know or link to the many online training courses
which are scattered throughout all the Things course listed below.

Note the repurpose toolkit which allows you to download the skeleton
course and add your own domain or institution references.
