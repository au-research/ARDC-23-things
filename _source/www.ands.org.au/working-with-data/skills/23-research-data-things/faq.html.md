[23
Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23_Things "23 things - wikipedia")
is a recognised training concept with several organisations already
using the idea to help Librarians, data managers and others to build
their understanding of research data and its potential.

Examples of other 23 Things programs

No! 23 Things is a self paced learning program, soÂ you can start at any
time. If you want to get started now either:

1.  start at Thing 1
2.  have a look at [all
    23](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/all23 "All 23 Things")
    and pick and choose what you want to learn more about.

If you are a person who cares for, and about, research data and want to
fill in some gaps, learn more, find out what others are thinking... then
this may be for you!

The program is likely to be of interest to:

1.  those who care for data: Librarians, Managers, Data custodians
2.  those who create data and want recognition for their data:
    Researchers, Early Career Researchers, Research Assistants
3.  those who are looking to incorporate data into their future careers:
    PhD students, Librarianship and Information management students.

23 (research data) Things is a self-directed learning program for anyone
who wants to learn more about research data: what it is, why it is such
a global hot topic, finding it, re-using it, managing it, describing it,
how to make it open to the world, tricks and traps and more.

You can do them all at once, in blocks, or spread them out over time
doing one a day or one a week. It is up to you.

For each Thing you will:

1.  Read, or watch, or do an activity

Choices, choices (of Things)
----------------------------

Most of the 23 Things will have aÂ choice of three activitiesÂ - you can
pick'n'mix activities to suit your interests.

1.  Getting started: activities for people just getting to know the
    amazing world of research data.
2.  Learn More: activities for people who have some knowledge of
    research data management, discovery but want to build on what they
    know.
3.  Challenge Me: for the technically minded or those who are keen to
    stretch themselves on how data works 'under the hood'.

You can choose a different stream each week, or work through the same
stream. 23 (research data) Things is your own self-learning program -
follow your own interests and requirements. If you're keen,Â you can do
all the streams of activities!

**Webinars**
------------

During 2016 we held regular webinars for participants and Community
Group Leaders to offer support, encourage each other and answer any
questions. the recordings from the initial webinars are open to all.

[Recording from the Kick off webinar for
everyone](https://youtu.be/dNRdAAdXhVs "Kick off webinar on YouTube")\
[Recording from the Community Group Leaders (only)
webinar](https://youtu.be/XxmouuVVTOM "Group Leaders webinar on YouTube")

</div>

**Community Groups**
--------------------

community groups are formed from a group of people in a local area
(geographical, workplace, virtual with common specific interests) who
meet on a regular basis to help each other with the 23 (research data)
Things program.

A local community catch up can take any form that the local community
want it to be.

Some groups have met each week and to do the Thing together and then
have a brief discussion. Others have done their own Thing, then they
come together for coffee, cake and a chat.

Community Group meetings can be low key - it doesn't have to be anything
elaborate. Community groups could run a bit like book groups... do the
task then talk about it together. Maybe your group could even ask
someone local with a bit of expertise in a particular area to talk to
the group about the Thing.

Workplace groups might want to include a discussion on if and how they
couldÂ introduce a particular Thing as a new concept in the organization.

**MeetUp**
----------

MeetUp is an online community group where those who wish to can post
comments in response to Thing activities and ask questions to others in
the community to answer.

During 2016 there was a Discussion Board for each stream of each
Thing.Â MeetUp Discussion Boards are open to registered MeetUp members
only (but it's free to join as a regular member). We are working to get
an archive of the MeetUp discussions to be included on the ANDS website.

**Credly badges**
-----------------

Credly badges are simply a digital ârewardâ for completing a Thing.Â You
can add badges to your LinkedIn profile, blogs and other social media to
indicate your involvement in the 23 (research data) Things program.

[More information about](http://openbadges.org/about/ "Open badges")
[Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/about/)

You can claim all 23 Thing badges and/or claim the final (super!) badge
for completion of yourÂ 23 (research data) Things journey.Â They are
claimed on a honour system by simply logging in to Credly from the link
provided at the bottom of each Thing description.Â Links are also
provided on Discussion Boards in MeetUp.

Whilst this program is designed for Australian research data
enthusiasts, many Things have international examples drawn from around
the world, or the Australian examples are indicative of best practice.

Everyone is welcome to participate but we will not be able to answer
questions specific to a particular country, other than Australia.

23 (research data) Things is open to anyone to re-use or change the
ideas, examples or activities to suit other contexts.
