Data sharing policies are becoming increasingly common in Australia and
internationally. Learn why research funders and journal publishers are
particularly influential when it comes to encouraging data availability.

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0007/584845/Activity-1-button.png){#t5-activity1 width="145" height="46"} Learn about new journal data policies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More and more journal publishers are asking authors to make the data
underpinning a journal article available. Itâs all about ensuring that
the research being described in the article is based on solid,
reproducible science. Thinking back to Thing 3: Data Sharing and
discovery Activity 2, rememberÂ Â that *available* can be 'open' or
'shared' through mediated/controlled access.

![publishers with data
policies](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0007/543616/funders-slide.png)

1.  Choose one of the links below to explore some of these policies
    1.  PLOS Medicine [data
        policy](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/s/data-availability "PLOS medicine data policy"),
        which also specifies preferred locations for the data.
    2.  The British Medical Journal [data
        policy](http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/article-types "British medical journal - data policy")
        (click on âData sharingâ).
    3.  Annals of Internal Medicine [data
        policy](http://annals.org/public/authorsinfo.aspx#data-sharing-and-reproducible-research)
2.  Read this blog post [Promoting research data sharing at Springer
    Nature](http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2016/07/05/promoting-research-data-sharing-springer-nature/ "springer nature - research data sharing")
    about the 4 levels of research data sharing policies. Spend a bit of
    time clicking the links near the bottom of the post: FAQs,
    policiesÂ inÂ full,Â list of trusted data repositories, preparing Data
    Availability Statements.

**Consider** how easy, or hard, it was for you to understand what is
required upon submission to one of these journals in regard to research
data.

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0008/584846/Activity-2-button.png){#t5-activity2 width="145" height="46"} Data sharing policies of major medical funders
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)
funded more than \$896 million in 2015 for health and medical research
including 1030 new grants to universities, medical research institutions
and hospitals across Australia.

1.  Quickly review the [NHMRC Open Access
    Policy](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/research/nhmrc_open_access_policy_15_january_2018_v2.pdf "NHMRC open access policy")
    (Section 4.2 and Appendix 2) and lifecycle diagram for data sharing
    we saw in Thing 1.
2.  International collaborations are increasingly common in our
    ever-connected world. Researchers in Australia are involved in
    projects funded by overseas bodies. Choose one of these major
    international funders of research and have a look at their data
    sharing policy:

-   [Wellcome
    Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/managing-grant/policy-data-management-and-sharing)
    in the UK
-   [Bill and Melinda Gates
    Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/General-Information/Open-Access-Policy)
    in the US (also look at the
    [FAQs](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/General-Information/Open-Access-Policy/Page-2)
    for more information)
-   [National Institutes of Health
    (NIH)](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/sharing.htm) in the US

Now imagine it is 2020â¦ **consider** what you think Australian research
funders will be requiring of researchers who are seeking project
funding.

**If you have time,** explore the statement supporting rapid data
release of genomics data to the scientific community from the
[International Cancer Genome
Consortium](https://icgc.org/icgc/goals-structure-policies-guidelines/e2-data-release-policies).
