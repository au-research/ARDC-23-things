What are DOIs and ORCIDs? These unique identifiers support data
citation, metrics for data and related research objects, disambiguation
of people,Â accurate attribution and impact metrics.

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0007/584845/Activity-1-button.png){#t6-activity1 width="145" height="46"} DOIs are unique (just like you)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) are unique identifiers that provide
persistent access to published articles, datasets, software versions and
a range of other research inputs and outputs. There are over 120 million
Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) in use, and last year DOIs were
'resolved' (clickedÂ on) over 5 billion times!

Each DOI is unique but a typical DOI looks like this:
http://doi.org/10.4225/08/50F62E0D359D5

DOIs can be used to collect citation metrics about the use of a dataset
or article.

1.  Start by watching this short 4.5min video [Persistent identifiers
    and data citation
    explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgqtiY7oZ6k) from
    Research Data Netherlands. It gives you a succinct, clear
    explanation of how DOIs underpin data citation.
2.  Have a look at the poster ** [*Building a culture of data
    citation*](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/383025/data_citation_poster.pdf "building a culture of data citation")
    (also shown below) - follow the arrows to see how DOIs are attached
    to datasets.

[![data citation
poster](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0011/589295/cultureofdatacitation.png)](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/383025/data_citation_poster.pdf "Building a culture of data citation")

3.  Letâs go to a data record which shows how DOIs are used. Click on
    this DOI to âresolveâ the DOI and take us to the record:
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/22/55BAE9DBD9670> (Population Health data
    collection for the City of Greater Bendigo)

The same record has been [syndicated to Research Data
Australia](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/population-health-collection-greater-bendigo/625007/?refer_q=).
Click on the DOI at the bottom of the page, under âIdentifiersâ. No
matter where the DOI appears it always resolves back to its original
datasetÂ record to avoid duplication. i.e. many records, one copy.

**If you have time:** Want to know more about DOIs? Flick through the
[ANDS Guide - Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system for research
data](https://www.ands.org.au/guides/doi).

**Consider:** should DOIs be routinely applied to all research outputs?
Remember that DOIs carry an expectation of persistence (maintenance
costs etc.) but can be used to collect metrics as well as link articles
and data (evidence of impact).

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0008/584846/Activity-2-button.png){#t6-activity2 width="145" height="46"} Getting to know ORCID
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What about identifiers for people? Think about the many forms a personâs
name may take or common names. Is the author JK Rowling the same person
as Joanne Rowling and Jo Rowling? More than 38,000 Americans have the
name James Smith!

Universities, funders and publishers worldwide now use ORCID to
differentiate between people with the same name by assigning individuals
with a unique identifier.

1\. Letâs start by going to [ORCID](http://orcid.org/). In the search box
at the very top of the page, enter *John David Burton* to search the
ORCID registry. Scan the list of results to find the entry for John
David Burton. How many versions of his name do you see?

2\. Now enter *Toby Burrows* into the search box. Open his ORCID record
to see a wonderful example of a rich ORCID record. Note he has combined
his ResearcherID and his Scopus Author ID with his ORCID.Â Scroll through
his list of works and look closely at *Source* to see the wide range of
sourcesÂ Â ofÂ Â his publications.

You can now choose from 3 activities that will get you in touch with
ORCID.

**Option 1. Donât have an ORCID record but would like one?**

Use this time to create your ORCID profile and make it as complete as
possible.

1.  Visit [ORCID](http://orcid.org/) and follow steps 1 and 2.
2.  When youâre done, add your ORCID iD to your email signature,
    LinkedIn profile and blog
3.  Send your new ORCID iD to a colleague and ask for some feedback on
    your profile

**Option 2. Already have an ORCID?**

When was the last time you logged in to update or enhance your profile?
You may be surprised at the additional functionality now available.

1.  Read Alice Meadowâs blog post [Six Things to do now you have an
    ORCID
    iD](http://orcid.org/blog/2015/07/23/six-things-do-now-you%E2%80%99ve-got-orcid-id)
2.  Now go to your ORCID profile and update it to be as current and
    complete as possible
3.  When youâre done, add your ORCID to your email signature, LinkedIn
    profile and blog
4.  Consider using the new [QR code feature](http://qrcode.orcid.org/)
    for your ORCID iD in new and unchartered ways

**Option 3. Donât want an ORCID?**

Get up to date with the latest features, functionality and news on the
[ORCID blog](https://orcid.org/blog) and explore the [Australian ORCID
Consortium](http://aaf.edu.au/orcid/) (most Australian universities are
members). ****

**Consider** how ORCID can be used to enhance your online profile.
