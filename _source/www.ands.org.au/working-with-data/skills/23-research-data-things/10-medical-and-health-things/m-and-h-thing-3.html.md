Data may be shared in many ways. Here we explore places, and ways, that
data can be shared and is currently being shared.

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0007/584845/Activity-1-button.png){#t3-activity1 width="145" height="46"} Exploring repositories
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Repositories enable discovery of data by publishing data descriptions
("metadata") about the data they hold - like a library catalogue
describes individual materials held in a library. Most repositories
provide access to the data itself, but not always. Data portals or
aggregators draw together research  data  records from a number of
repositories, e.g. [Research Data Australia
(RDA)](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/) aggregates records from over
100 Australian research repositories.

1.  Click on this description of a dataset from the [National Survey of
    Midlife Development in the United States
    (MIDUS)](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/studies/2760): a
    collaborative, interdisciplinary investigation of patterns,
    predictors, and consequences of midlife development in the areas of
    physical health, psychological well-being, and social
    responsibility.
2.  Have a close look at the record to see the ways this record is
    discoverable and accessible. Explore how a secondary user can access
    the data and what formats they can download it in, and see how it is
    connected to hundreds of research publications.

**Discipline specific repositories**

1.  Start by going to [re3data.org](http://www.re3data.org/)
2.  Click on Browse &gt; Browse by subject &gt; click on Medicine in the
    second ring from the middle
3.  Explore the range of repositories listed under ‘Medicine’. Can you
    find one relevant to your research?

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0008/584846/Activity-2-button.png){#t3-activity2 width="145" height="46"} An introduction to ‘open’, ‘shared’, and ‘closed’ data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may have noticed that not all data described is available for
immediate access.

1.  Watch this 2.5 minute video from the Open Data Institute titled
    [*Open/Closed/Shared: the world of
    data*](https://vimeo.com/125783029)*.* Note that ‘shared’ data can
    also be called *mediated* or *controlled access* - this is often the
    preferred way for medical data to be published.
2.  Now open this page on [Open
    Data](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/articulating-the-value-of-open-data/open-data)
    to see a more in-depth view of why data is sometimes open, shared or
    closed.
3.  Have a look at one of these examples of open data from medical or
    health research:
    -   [State of the Tropics - Society - Health - Under 5
        mortality](https://research.jcu.edu.au/researchdata/default/detail/50b06e76d6427812e4cda41b01613d99/)
    -   [Hawaii Aging with HIV Cardiovascular Study, 2009-2014
        (ICPSR 36389)](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/studies/36389?classification=NACDA.V)
    -   [PALS (Pregnancy and Lifestyle
        Study)](https://data.unisa.edu.au/Dataset.aspx?DatasetID=96137)

Not all data is suitable to be openly shared in its original form, such
as identifiable patient medical records. Strategies for sharing
sensitive data will be explored in [Thing 4: Sharing sensitive
data](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/10-medical-and-health-things/m-and-h-thing-4 "Thing 4 - sharing sensitive data").

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0009/584847/Activity-3-button.png){#t3-activity3 width="145" height="46"} Data sharing practices
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Take a look at this infographic from Wiley titled [*Research Data
    Sharing
    Insights*](http://www.acscinf.org/PDF/Giffi-%20Researcher%20Data%20Insights%20--%20Infographic%20FINAL%20REVISED.pdf "Research Data Sharing Insights")
    \[PDF, 2.08MB\]  It provides a succinct overview of current data
    sharing practice and perceptions.

    ![researchdatasharing](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0006/589281/Researchdatasharing.png){width="250"
    height="162"}

2.  Note that 48% of ‘heath scientists’ say they are sharing their work.
    Has this been your experience? Also note where the work is shared.
    What implications does this have for your work / the people you work
    with?
3.  Data sharing can also be undertaken by Industry - see what a
    [collection of pharmaceutical
    companies](https://www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com/Default.aspx)
    are doing as an example. What are your thoughts on this?
