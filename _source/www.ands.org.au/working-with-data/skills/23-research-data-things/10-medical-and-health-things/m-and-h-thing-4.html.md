Sharing sensitive data requires careful consideration, but it can be
done. Find out how.

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0007/584845/Activity-1-button.png){#t4-activity1 width="145" height="46"} Sensitive data can be shared!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sensitive data can be **human data** (e.g. health and personal data,
secret or sacred practices) or **ecological data** (may place vulnerable
species at risk).

Given the nature of this type of data, you might expect that it canât be
shared and reused. But in many cases, it can be.

1\. **Explore** one of these examples of published sensitive data:

-   Remember we met the Pregnancy and Lifestyle study (PALS) dataset in
    Thing 3 Activity 2 as an example of open data? It shows how
    sensitive data can be safely de-identified and openly shared. Click
    on [Pregnancy and Lifestyle study
    (PALS)](https://researchdata.ands.org.au/de-identified-dataset-reproductive-outcome/617280/)
    and then âGo to Data Providerâ to see the actual data.
-   This 1 page story tells how sensitive data from the [*Australian
    Longitudinal Study of Womenâs Health
    data*](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/publishing-and-reusing-data/data-reuse/benefiting-womens-health "Australian longitudinal study of women's health")
    has been successfully published for almost 20 years. Note the data
    is available through conditional access, as introduced in [Thing 3:
    Data sharing and discovery Activity
    2](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/skills/23-research-data-things/10-medical-and-health-things/m-and-h-thing-3 "t3-activity2").

2\. **How do you share and publish sensitive data?**

1.  Browse through the ANDS [sensitive
    data](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/sensitive-data/sharing-sensitive-data "sharing sensitive data")
    webpage.
2.  Click on the[Publishing and sharing sensitive
    data](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/385309/sensitive-decision-tree.pdf "Publishing and sharing sensitive data poster")
    flowchart to get an overview of issues and solutions.

[![Publishing and sharing
](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0008/589292/Publishing-and-Sharing-Sensitive-Data.png){width="235"
height="330"}](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/385309/sensitive-decision-tree.pdf "sensitve data decision tree")

3.  **If you have time:** follow a couple of the links on the sensitive
    data page which are of particular interest to you.

**Consider:** Imagine you are either a researcher or a participant in a
health survey:

-   Participant: what questions might you first ask the researcher about
    intended sharing and reuse of the survey data?
-   Researcher: What responses would you need to prepare to anticipate
    participants questions about publishing âtheir data for all the
    world to seeâ?

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0008/584846/Activity-2-button.png){#t4-activity2 width="145" height="46"} De-identification of data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

De-identification is a process that balances the risks of producing safe
data with maintaining useful data. When it is done well the risk of
disclosing information referring to individuals should be negligible.

1.  Explore this [guide to anonymisation of medical
    data](http://med.data.edu.au/anonymisation)
2.  Discover some [tools and
    resources](http://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/enabling-data-reuse/de-identifying-data)
    for information about de-identification of data.

**Consider:** are there any tools or resources you have come across that
could help a researcher de-identify or anonymise their data?

![](https://www.ands.org.au/__data/assets/image/0009/584847/Activity-3-button.png){#t4-activity3 width="145" height="46"} Consent for data sharing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Informed consent is required from human participants before obtaining
and publishing data. The best time to obtain consent is before the data
are collected. Participants should, at a minimum, be informed about
procedures for maintaining privacy and the conditions under which the
data will be shared.

Explore one, or more, of the following consent forms that ask for
permission to share research data:

-   [UK Data Archive sample consent
    form](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/media/112638/ukdamodelconsent.pdf)
-   [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health consent
    tools](https://www.ga4gh.org/ga4ghtoolkit/regulatoryandethics/ "Genomics and health consent tools")
    (halfway down page. Open and focus on Section C)
-   [Health Science Alliance Biobank
    Consent](http://www.tcrn.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/uploads/images/HSA%20Biobank%20Consent%20Form%20V%201%201.pdf)

**Consider:** would you be willing to sign that consent form?

If you have time, check out theÂ [Personal Genome Projectâs Global
Network Guidelines](http://www.personalgenomes.org) which say
thatÂ "risks of participant re-identification are addressed up front, as
an integral part of the consent and enrollment process; neither
anonymity nor confidentiality of participant identities or their data
are promised to research participants" (and if youâre really keen check
out [this article](http://arep.med.harvard.edu/pdf/Lunshof08.pdf)
examining the issue in more depth).
