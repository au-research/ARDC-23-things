**In the reflective survey**: people have been sharing their experience
of 23 (research data) Things

-   "23 RD Things did alert me to so many aspects of research data and
    it started a conversation in our organisation: We will be sharing
    data for the first time, our Spatial Data Unit is now aware of
    existing Government frameworks. The structured collection,
    management and sharing of \[sensitive\] data will be a major topic
    in 2017. Last but certainly not the least, we will have to up-skill
    in our unit to have sufficient data knowledge and skills."

<!-- -->

-   "I undertook the program to encourage my team to undertake it. It
    has improved my skills and my team is now more confident inÂ Â talking
    about data to researchers. It has been exciting to watch the team
    explore the things and take very different paths along the journey."

**On Meetup:** questions have been asked (and answered!), resources
shared and connections made.

-   âThe interview toolkit by Monash is extremely useful. I feel like I
    could just pick it up, contextualise it to my institution, and use
    it straight away!â
-   âWhile it would certainly be nice to have one metadata schema to
    rule them all â¦ it is clear from the records in this exercise that
    disciplinary repositories/schemas utilize much more detailed and
    specific metadata than the more general repositoriesâ
-   â... Unfortunately university IP policies vary dramatically, and so
    the intricacies of whether the researcher or the university owns the
    copyright in what ever it is that is to be licensed is not always
    easy to ascertain. But itâs important, because, generally, only the
    rights holder hasÂ Â Â Â the capacity to determine and or apply a
    licence.â
-   âThe Meetup forum gave me a lot to think about, my local group
    provided lots of excellent discussion and, of course, working my way
    through the content on the ANDS site has taught me a lot. I will not
    deny that it was challenging at times and I am really glad I stuck
    with it.â

**From a blog post:**

-   "Like many things in life, I find that with the 23 (Research Data)
    Things, the more that I put into it, the more I get out of it. The
    more I engage with and explore the ideas presented, the more I
    discover. And the more paths that I wander down, the more
    connections that I make, the more I feel motivated and excited by
    all the possibilities of what I am learning."

**From the State Library of Queensland:**

[![SLQ

height="166"}](https://vimeo.com/183465376 "SLQ 23(research data)Things video")

23 (research data) Things was certainly embraced by the team at the
State Library of Queensland.Â We've enjoyed seeing their luscious cakes
on twitter,Â hearing their contributions in our webinarsÂ and joining them
for crash coursesÂ Â and sprints to the finish.

Now you can hearÂ them tell theirÂ 23 (research data) Things story by

There are over 90 Australian courses offering data related units in
Information Science, Health, Business, IT, Engineering, Science, and
more. Data courses are offered across a range of Universities, at
undergraduate and postgraduate levels, online and on campus - something
for everyone.

Sometimes there are individual data units offered within a discipline
degree, others have a number of electives or majors. Some courses
specifically in Data Management are also available

eg **Charles Sturt University**[**Graduate Certificate and Masters
Specialisation in Data
Management**](http://www.csu.edu.au/infostudies/ "Graduate Certificate and Masters Specialisation in Data Management")

From 2017 onwards the School of Information Studies at Charles Sturt
University will be offering a Graduate Certificate in Data Management
(GCDM). As practicing information professionals or researchers, formal
study in Data Management will enable you to demonstrate you can fill an
identified professional skill and knowledge gap. Completion of the GCDM
qualification provides evidence you have studied the fundamental
principles, key concepts, tools, standards, and techniques of data
curation and data management.

The GCDM will comprise of four subjects â the first three subjects are
core and are:

-   INF461 Introduction to Data Management: Governance, Standards and
    Ethics;
-   INF462 Data Curation; and,
-   INF463 Introduction to Data Tools and Analytics.

For the 4^th^ subject, students are offered a choice of either:

-   INF449 Research Data Management; or,
-   INF522 Project Management in Information Agencies

This Graduate Certificate is offered part time over one year (two
subjects per session) and is completely online. This mode provides
students with the flexibility to study at a time and place that suits
their work and life commitments, with access to a wide range of learning
materials, support and communication tools online.

Alternatively, if you are currently undertaking the Master of
Information Studies at CSU, you can elect to do the subjects as above to
graduate with a Specialisation in Data Management: a Master of
Information Studies (Data Management).
